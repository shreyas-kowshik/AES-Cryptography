Encryption :
5 Rounds AES -> Fietsel Cipher (number of rounds is taken as input) -> 5 rounds AES

For documentation : Refer to code `cipher.c` comments.
For understanding Fietsel cipher structure, see `Fietsel-Cipher.pdf`. 
Details on S-box and permutation tables are in the code and are commented.

Instructions To run :

gcc cipher.c && ./a.out

Enter the input ciphertext as 32 hexadecimal characters (all in small).
Enter the cipherkey as 32 hexadecimal characters (all in small).
Enter the number of rounds to use for the Fietsel Cipher.
Enter if intermediate outputs of each round is to be printed.
